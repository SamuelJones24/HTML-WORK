# HTML-WORK

This is my first attempt at making a portfolio website.
I will probablly continue to update this website or create a new on in the future.
HUGE THANKS TO ZACK LE.
I could not have done any of this without him and he tought me the majority of what I know.
Big thanks to Maddie Stanley for all the artsy design stuff because I can't match colors.
As of 10/24/2022 this website is about 15% done.
